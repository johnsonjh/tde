Overview
********

Description
===========

TDE is a simple, public domain, multi-file/multi-window binary and text
file editor written for IBM PCs and close compatibles running either
DOS, Windows or Linux.  TDE is suitable for editing batch files, binary
files, text files, and various computer language source code files.
The only limit on the number and size of files that TDE can handle is
the amount of memory.  Likewise, the only limit on the number of
windows is the amount of memory.  There is no preset maximum number of
files or windows that may be open at any one time.

Introduction
============

I (Frank Davis) work with data files, computer source code, and various
text files quite a bit.  Most of the features in TDE are related, in
some way, to handling those types of files.  The various window and
cursor commands in TDE are really nice for comparing and editing source
code or output files.  A good collection of block commands is available
for use on source code and formatted data files.  For what little word
processing I do, TDE has a few simple commands for formatting text and
paragraphs.  In short, TDE contains most of the features that I use
most of the time in an easy to use, easy to remember, and easy to
configure editor.  I hope you find TDE as easy to use for most of your
routine editing as me.

Usage
*****

The general format for running TDE is:

     tde [-v] [-i CONFIG] [-w [WORKSPACE]]
         [options] [filename(s)] [options] [-f|F|g|G[=] PATTERN filename(s)]

Everything is optional -- running without any parameters will either
bring up a prompt to load a filename (or display the directory list for
a pattern), or automatically load the workspace if `tde.wsp' is present
in the current directory (`.tdewsp' in UNIX).  The three options `-v',
`-i' and `-w' must be first, but can appear in any order amongst
themselves.

`-v'
     Enter viewer mode, where every file is loaded read-only.

`-i'
     Read the specified configuration file (after reading the global
     and local files; *note Configuration::).

`-w'
     If this is used by itself, TDE will load the workspace from its
     home directory; if it doesn't exist the usual prompt is displayed.
     If WORKSPACE is present, but no other options, TDE will load the
     given workspace.  When used with other options, TDE will load as
     normal, using WORKSPACE as the filename of the workspace.

`-f'
`-F'
`-g'
`-G'
     These options cause TDE to search files for PATTERN.  The lower
     case letter will ignore case, whilst the upper case letter will
     match it.  `F' will perform a text-based search; `G' will perform
     a regular expression search.  The normal operation is to load the
     first matching file, positioned at the first match; adding `='
     immediately after the letter will instead create a window
     containing the matching lines from all files.  If a directory is
     specified all files in that directory will be searched.


   Filenames (and directories) can include wildcards (*note DirList::,
*note DefineGrep::).  If a directory is specified, the directory list
will be brought up for it.

   Options begin with either `-' or `+'.  An option starting with `-'
will apply to all following files; an option starting with `+' will
apply to only one file.  A lower case option letter will apply to the
file(s) coming after it; an upper case letter will apply to the file
before it (and possibly those after it).  For options that apply to
following files, the normal behavior can be restored by adding `-'
after the letter.

`a'
     Usually files are only loaded into the editor at the request of
     the user (by closing the current file or explicitly loading the
     next); this option will load all files into the editor immediately.

`b[N]'
`b!'
     Load files as binary, using N as the line length (default is 64);
     if N is zero, force loading files as text; if N is negative, load
     text files as normal and use the positive value of N as the line
     length for binary files (without prompting).  Alternatively, skip
     binary files altogether.

`c TITLE'
     Name the window TITLE; use `.' for the filename (which won't be
     split like it usually is).  This option always applies to only one
     file.

`e MACRO'
     Execute MACRO after loading each file.  If MACRO refers to an
     existing file, it will be read as a macro file.

`l[LANG]'
     If LANG is absent, syntax highlighting will be disabled; otherwise
     it will be used as the language, overriding the filename test.

`n'
     Create a new (scratch) window.

`r'
     Load files as read-only.

`s'
     Set the scratch flag for files.

`t[N]'
     Use a physical tab size of N (default is 8; 0 will deflate tabs).

`[LINE][:COL]'
     Start at the specified position.  If LINE is negative it will be
     taken from the end of the file (i.e. `-1' is the last line, `-2'
     is the second last, etc.).  If COL is negative it will be taken
     from the end of the line (i.e. `0' is EOL, `-1' is the last
     character, `-2' is the second last, etc.).  This option always
     applies to only one file -- start with `+' for the next file, `-'
     for the previous (sic).

`+OFFSET'
     Move to the specified offset (prefix with `0x' for hexadecimal) in
     the file.  It can be used with text files, but OFFSET is not the
     same as the file offset, since line endings are not counted.  This
     option always applies to only one file, as above.


   There are also a number of help options.  These options must be the
only argument present.

`/?'
`-?'
`--help'
     Display a (long) help screen, including version and contact
     information.

`--version'
     Just display the current version and release date.

`-g?'
`-G?'
     Display the regular expression help screen.

`-??'
     Display the wildcard help screen.


   Finally, TDE can be used as a filter, where it reads from standard
input and writes to standard output.  In this instance, input is
treated as an implicit (scratch) file after the command, so it is
always read first and the upper case version of options is required.

Examples
========

     tde -b FILE1 -b- FILE2
     tde FILE1 +B FILE2

   Both load FILE1 as binary (using the default line length of 64) and
auto-detect the type of FILE2.

     dir | tde >dir.lst

   Pipe the output of `dir' into TDE and save its output into `dir.lst'.

     unzip -c tde51ss | tdv -Lc

   View TDE's source using C syntax highlighting (`tdv' is equivalent
to `tde -v').

     tde -lpascal file.c file.bat -l file.for -l- file.cbl

   This will load `file.c' and `file.bat' using Pascal syntax
highlighting, disable syntax highlighting for `file.for' and use the
filename to determine if `file.cbl' should have it.

     tdv -b! ...

   View every text file in the current directory and all subdirectories.

     tde -F s_output .;[dwu]*/*.[ch]

   Do a case-sensitive, text-based search for `s_output', in all the
`.c' and `.h' files in the current directory and the subdirectories
starting with `d', `w' and `u'.  UNIX users can use `:' instead of `;'.

     tde -e "JumpToPosition \"-1:0\" Rturn LineDown BottomLine LineUp" FILE

   Load FILE, moving to EOL of the last line, with EOF at the bottom of
the window.

Configuration
*************

TDE uses three external files: `tde.cfg', `tde.hlp' and `tde.shl' (in
UNIX the dot is at the front).  These files are read from the home
directory (the "global" file) and/or the current directory (the "local"
file).  The home directory is determined by the environment variables
`TDEHOME' or `HOME', or the same path as TDE itself, whichever exists
first (however, in order for `HOME' to be used in DOS or Windows,
`tde.cfg' must already exist in it).  The default `tde.cfg' and
`tde.hlp' files can be found in the `config' directory (without any dot
for UNIX); the default `tde.shl' is called `tdedist.shl' in the source
distribution (its `tde.shl' includes TDE's own highlighting).

`tde.cfg'
     This file defines what key performs what function (including
     macros) and the initial state of the editor (mode settings and
     colors).  It can also define upper and lower case letters and the
     sort sequence.  Please see the default file for more information.
     It is loaded globally first and then locally (i.e. both locations,
     not one or the other).

`tde.hlp'
     This file contains the screen(s) displayed when *Note Help:: is
     pressed.  It is at most 50 lines, with at most 100 characters per
     line; any more than this will be ignored.  Lines need not be the
     same length, as all lines will be space-padded to the length of
     the longest.  Two screens are present, one for the normal help and
     another for read-only files; separate the two with a `<<<>>>'
     sequence.  If `tde.hlp' doesn't exist locally it will be read
     globally.  A local file need only define one type of screen; the
     other will still be read globally.

`tde.shl'
     This file supplies the colors used for syntax highlighting and the
     information required to assign those colors to a particular file.
     It searches for the language locally first and then tries
     globally.  Note that when a local language is found, all the
     patterns are prefixed with the current directory.


Syntax Highlighting
===================

The colors always come first in the file.  They are global for all
languages.  Colors are defined in the same manner as in the
configuration file (see `config/tde.cfg').  Following are all the
recognized colors, with their default color in brackets.

`background'
     The default background color for all the following (blue).

`normal'
     The color for any text that is not explicitly highlighted (yellow).

`bad'
     The color for invalid components, such as malformed numbers,
     character literals containing too many characters, or unterminated
     string and character literals (bright red).

`keyword'
     The color of keywords (white).

`comment'
     The color of comments (grey).

`function'
     The color of function names (bright green).

`string'
     The color of string literals (bright cyan).

`character'
     The color of character literals (bright cyan).

`integer'
     The color of numbers (in decimal, without a point; bright cyan).

`binary'
     The color of binary (base 2) numbers (bright cyan).

`octal'
     The color of octal (base 8) numbers (bright cyan).

`hex'
     The color of hexadecimal (base 16) numbers (bright cyan).

`real'
     The color of numbers with a decimal point (bright cyan).

`preprocessor'
     The color of preprocessor statements (cyan).

`symbol'
     The color of any non-alphanumeric that is otherwise unrecognized
     (white).


   The language definitions follow the colors.  Each definition is
started with `language' and continues until the next `language' or EOF.
The following keywords can be used to define a language (where `[]'
indicates an optional component and `|' indicates one or the other):

`language NAME [from] PARENT'
     Associates NAME with the syntax highlighting information.  This is
     what is used to select a particular syntax highlight (*note
     SyntaxSelect::).  If PARENT exists, this language will inherit all
     of PARENT's language definitions.

`pattern WILDCARDS'
     Must follow immediately after `language'.  It is a space-separated
     list of wildcards to identify a language from a file's extension
     (or name, or even path).

`case match | ignore'
     Determines if keywords will be case sensitive or insensitive.  The
     default is `match'.

`startword LIST'
`inword    LIST'
`innumber  LIST'
     A list (or range) of characters that may start a word (or, more
     correctly, an identifier), be found within a word and be found
     within numbers.

`comment STRING'
`comment STRING1 STRING2'
     Indicates STRING will begin a line comment (stops at the end of the
     line), or that STRING1 and STRING2 will begin and end a block
     comment (can extend across multiple lines).  Each string can be up
     to four characters and there can be two of each type of comment.

`function CHAR'
     Identifiers that are followed by CHAR (allowing for whitespace, but
     not across line boundaries) are given the `function' color.

`preprocessor CHAR2 [spanline CHAR]'
     Lines that begin with CHAR2 (one or two characters) are given the
     `preprocessor' color.  If the line ends in CHAR, the preprocessor
     will continue on the next line.

`binary CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
`octal  CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
`hex    CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
     Define the format of binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers.  The
     first form indicates a prefix (such as C's `0x123'), the second a
     suffix (such as assembly's `123h').

`string    C1 [C2]       [spanline CHAR] [newline]'
`character C1 [C2] [NUM] [spanline CHAR] [newline]'
     Define the starting and closing characters of string and character
     literals.  If C2 is missing, it is taken the same as C1.
     `spanline' indicates the literal will continue onto the next line
     if this line ends in CHAR; `newline' indicates that it will
     continue onto the next line, regardless.  NUM is the maximum
     number of characters permitted in a character literal.  The
     default is one; if it is zero, `character' functions identically
     to `string'.

`escape CHAR'
     When CHAR is encountered within a string or character literal, the
     following character is skipped over.

`keyword LIST'
     The words in LIST will be displayed in the `keyword' color.  Note
     that all of the color keywords can be used in this fashion (when
     LIST starts with a character from `startword').

`COLOR LIST'
     Use COLOR to display the words in LIST.

`InflateTabs'
`LTabSize'
`Macro'
`PseudoMacro'
`PTabSize'
`UserMenu'
     The same as the configuration file, although macros must be
     defined using a two-key combination.

   Remove all spaces from the end of each line in the block.  This
function is only available for line blocks.


File: tde.info,  Node: BlockUnComment,  Next: BlockUndent,  Prev: BlockTrimTrailing,  Up: Alphabetical List

BlockUnComment
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+E'
Menu:   Block > Comment > Remove

   Remove the comments (line or block, but not both) from the block.
The comments must be part of the block.  The first line of the block
must have a comment, but it is not necessary for every line to have one.

   For line comments, the comment will be removed from the beginning of
the line (or box), as well as the space after it, if one; a stream
block will only remove the comment from the first line of the stream.

   For block comments, the comments will be removed from the beginning
and end of a stream or the left and right edge of each line in a box.
A line block depends on the first line: if it has both start and end
comments, each line is tested; if the start and end comments are on
lines by themselves, those lines are deleted; otherwise it is assumed
to be like a stream, with the comment ending at the last line.

BlockUndent
===========

Key:    `Ctrl+K Ctrl+U'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Undent

   Perform a `BackSpace' or `BackTab' (depending on the indent mode) on
the first non-blank line of the block and carry that change throughout
the remaining lines.  A box block effectively treats the left edge as
the beginning of the line; this function is not available for a stream
block.

   If there are lines in the block that begin before the first line,
the initial characters will be deleted and the lines will be placed in
the undo buffer (*note RetrieveLine::).  Example:

       line1
     line2

Undenting these two lines would remove the two spaces from `line1', but
also the first two characters of `line2':

     line1
     ne2

============

Key:    `Ctrl+K U'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Undent spaces

   Ask for a number and remove that many spaces from the beginning of
the block.  If the number is greater than the number of spaces on the
first non-blank line, use that number instead.  *Note BlockUndent::,
for a side-effect.

   This function has two uses, depending on when it used.  If used on a
zoomed (full-screen) window, it will close only that window (unlike
*Note Quit::, which will also close all hidden windows).  If used on a
split window, it will remove and hide the window, increasing the window
above or below, or left or right, and making it current.

   Loads a file into the editor (or switches to it if it is already
loaded) and, if the cursor is on a word, searches it for that word
(using a regular expression).  The default file is `tde.txt' and the
default expression is `^<~>' (where `~' is replaced with the word);
these can be changed in the configuration.  The file can have a
relative path, but if it exists when the editor is started, or once it
has been loaded, it will be made absolute.

DefineDiff
==========

Key:    `Shift+F11'
Menu:   Search > Begin Diff

   Start a "diff", the difference between two visible windows.  The
diff is capable of ignoring all space, or just leading space, on a
line; it can also ignore blank lines, and line endings (usually in
conjunction with ignore all space).  The case mode (*note
ToggleSearchCase::) determines if the diff will ignore or match case.

DefineGrep
==========

Key:    `Shift+F12'
Key:    `Ctrl+F12'
Key:    `Shift+Alt+Q'
Menu:   File > Grep > File Find

   Search a list of filenames and/or wildcards for a pattern.  If `RegX'
is checked, the pattern will be a regular expression; if unchecked,
straight text.  If `Results' is checked, all matching lines will be
copied to a new window, prefixed with the filename, line number and
column; otherwise it will load the first file that matches and position
the cursor at the match.  If `Load all' is checked, all matching files
will be loaded into the editor, positioned either at the first match
(`Results' unchecked), or at the beginning of the file (`Results'
checked).  If `Binary' is checked, files determined to be binary will
autoload using the last value of `-b' (*note Usage::); otherwise binary
files will be ignored.

   This function will also define the search string (*note
RepeatFindForward::, *note RepeatRegXForward::), but changing the
search string will not affect the grep.  *Note RepeatGrep::.

   *Note DirList::, for a description of wildcards.  Wildcards for this
function can also be used for directories and the special path `...'
will traverse subdirectories.  For example, `d*/.../*.c' will find all
the `.c' files in all the directories starting with `d' and all their
subdirectories.  The files will be sorted according to the current
directory list order.

DefineSearch
============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F5'
Menu:   Search > Search

   Start a search.  The pattern can be either plain text, or check
`RegX' for a regular expression.  To search the block it must be marked
in the current file.  The `All files' option will search across all
currently loaded files; it will ignore non-file (scratch) windows
(unless one happens to be current).  Since it is not possible to search
both the block and all files, checking one will uncheck the other.  The
`Results' option will create a new window containing all matching lines
of the search (prompting to continue if wrap occurred), prefixed by
filename, line number and column.  Generating results across all files
will always start the search from the beginning.  *Note RepeatSearch::.

RetrieveLine::.


File: tde.info,  Node: DirList,  Next: DuplicateLine,  Prev: DeleteLine,  Up: Alphabetical List

DirList
=======

Key:    `Alt+F1'
Menu:   File > Directory

   Select a subdirectory (or the current if none) and/or a wildcard
pattern and list the matching files and all subdirectories.  Select a
directory (placed first and indicated by a trailing slash (`/') to move
into it (provided it is not empty).  The parent directory can be
selected by the `../' entry, or by using `BackSpace'; another drive can
be selected by typing the drive letter, followed by a colon (`:'), or
vice versa (colon then letter).  The files can be sorted by filename or
extension by using the `SortBoxBlock' key (`Alt+S' by default).  Typing
a character will select each file that begins with that character;
additional characters (within half a second) will then narrow the
selection down.  A new path and/or pattern can be entered by pressing
`Tab'.

   The wildcards might be a bit more flexible than DOS/Windows users
are accustomed to.  The `*' character can be used anywhere (so `a*z'
matches all files that start with `a' and end in `z').  Brackets can be
used to match a character in a list (so `[aeiou]*' matches any file that
starts with a vowel).  If the list starts with `!' or `^' it matches
any character not in the list (so `[!aeiou]*' matches any file that does
_not_ start with a vowel).  The list may also contain a range --
`[a-z]' represents all lower case letters.  Multiple patterns can be
specified by separating with `;' (or `:' in UNIX), so `*.txt;*.doc'
will find all `.txt' and `.doc' files.  Exclusions can be achieved by
separating with `!', thus `!*.exe;*.com' will find everything _except_
`.exe' and `.com' files and `*.txt;*.doc!r*' will find all `.txt' and
`.doc' files, except those starting with `r'.  To find a literal `;' or
`!' place it inside a list.

   *Caution*: the extension dot is just a normal character, so `*.*'
will only match files that have an extension; to match all files only a
single `*' is required.  To match files without an extension use `!*.*'
(the DOS method of `*.' will not work).

     `%F'    copy the current filename to the command, using the
             absolute path
     `%p'    prompt for a parameter for the command
     `%w'    copy the current word to the command
     `%W'    copy the current string to the command

   The filename will be automatically quoted if it contains a space or
any of the characters `+;,=%' and there is no quote (`"' or `'') before
it; insert an equal sign after the percent symbol to prevent that
(`%=f').  The function will fail if either `%f' or `%F' is used and the
current file is a scratch window.  If the cursor is not on a word or
string, it will prompt for one.

   There are also a few options:

     Capture output   capture the output of the command (`stderr' first,
                      followed by `stdout') into a new window (or
                      replace the current output) and make it the
                      current window; there is never a pause
     No echo          don't output the command
     No pause         return immediately, don't wait for a key
     Original files   don't save the files in the editor, use the
                      originals still on disk
     Reload files     reload modified files without prompting

   A blank command will run the shell, always with no echo and no
pause, but unlike *Note Shell::, files can be saved and automatically
reloaded.

GotoWindow
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F11'
Menu:   Window > Goto

   Select a window by number and letter, or filename.  If the string
starts with a digit, it is assumed to be the file number; if there is
no following letter, find the first (visible) window.  If the string
does not start with a digit, it is assumed to be the start of the
filename (the name itself, not the path).  If no window is chosen (i.e.
an empty string) a window list is displayed.  This is similar to the
directory list (*note DirList::).  This list uses symbols to indicate
the type of window.  The first symbol is `!' for the current window,
`-' for a hidden window and `+' for a visible window.  Then comes the
window number and letter and the three file indicators: `!' for
read-only, `#' for scratch and `*' for modified.  The window title or
relative file name is last, which also determines the sorting.  Typing
a number will select that window number; typing anything else will
select the name.

ISearchForward
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+S'
Menu:   Search > ISearch >

   Incremental (or interactive) searching finds the search string as it
is typed in.  TDE's isearch is based on Emacs.  The default keys are
`Shift+Ctrl+S' for forward searching and `Shift+Ctrl+R' for backward;
however, within isearch, `Ctrl+S' and `Ctrl+R' can be used.  Pressing
these keys again will immediately start a search with the previous find
string (not necessarily isearch); otherwise they will continue the
search with the current string.  `LineUp' and `LineDown' will cycle
through the find history.  `BackSpace' can be used to remove entered
characters, returning to the previous position.  `CopyWord',
`WordRight', `WordEndRight' and `Ctrl+W' will append the remainder of
the word to the search string; likewise with the `String' functions and
`Shift+Ctrl+W'.  If no search string has been entered, the complete
word or string will be copied.  `ToggleSearchCase' will do the obvious.
`Esc' will stop the search at the current position; `AbortCommand' and
`Ctrl+G' will restore the original position before the search was
started.  `Enter'/`Rturn' will stop the search when entering characters
or using the ISearch functions to continue it; otherwise the search
will be continued.  The previous position is set to the original
position, not to the last matching instance; if aborted, it is set to
the aborted position.

line number will be taken from the end of the file (`-1' is the last
line); a negative column from the end of the line (`0' is EOL, `-1' is
the last character).  The offset always uses a binary line ending, even
if the file is not.  It can be specified in hexadecimal by prefixing
with `0x' (thus `1024' and `0x400' are the same position).

the first.

   The current window will become the current browser window if it is a
results (*note DefineSearch::, *note DefineGrep::) or output (*note
Execute::) window.  If there is no browser window, find the first
results or output window after the current; the first before the
current; or the current window if it is scratch.  If the current window
becomes the current browser window, the current line will be used,
rather than the next.

   A line will be recognised as a browser line if it contains nothing
but a filename, or a filename with at least one number.  The first
number will assumed to be a line number; if there is another number, it
will assumed to be a column.  Each item can be separated by a space,
tab, colon, semicolon or comma.  Only the first four such items will be
tested for a filename.

PopupRuler
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+='
Menu:   Other > Popup Ruler

   Creates a ruler at the current cursor position, which can be moved
around the screen.  If the line number display is on (*note
ToggleLineNumbers::) it will be used to count lines; if it is off, it
can be turned on, but it can't be turned off.

   The arrow keys will move the ruler; in conjunction with `Ctrl' the
window will move (with the ruler maintaining its position in the file).
`StartOfLine' will move the ruler to the first column.  `Home' will
move the window to the first column; `End' will move the window to the
end of the longest line currently visible.
`(Half)ScreenUp/Down/Left/Right' and `Top/EndOfFile' will move the
window appropriately.  `Esc' will remove the ruler and restore the
original window position.

last window, the next file on the command line will be opened, or the
editor will exit if none.  If there are multiple windows or files, then
if there is a hidden window, it becomes the current; otherwise the
window above or below, or to the left or right, will grow to accomodate
the closed window; if this is not possible, the window will not be
closed.

RecordMacro
===========

Key:    `Alt+F3'
Menu:   Other > Record/Stop

   Record a macro -- a series of functions and characters that can be
played back with a single key.  This function serves to both start the
recording and then stop it.  The recording will also stop when the
assigned key is pressed -- this is a recursive macro, that will
continue to execute until an error condition occurs (typically hitting
the end of the file).  If the *Note PseudoMacro:: key is used for the
assignment, a pseudo-macro will be recorded using the two characters to
the left of the cursor as the trigger.

   Most prompts will be stored with the macro, but certain critical
choices will not, for example: `Overwrite existing file (y/n)?'.

SumBlock
========

Key:    `Alt+Grey+'
Menu:   Block > Sum

   Sum the numbers in a box block.  The numbers are treated as signed
decimal.  If the cursor is at TOF or EOF, or if the file is read-only,
the sum will be displayed in a message; otherwise it will be inserted
(or overwritten) into the file.


File: tde.info,  Node: SwapBlock,  Next: SyntaxSelect,  Prev: SumBlock,  Up: Alphabetical List

SwapBlock
=========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+S'
Menu:   Block > Swap

   Mark another region in the file and swap it with the block.  This
function is not available for a stream block.

   Swapping a box block has two separate operations, depending on the
size of the block and the location of the cursor.  If the cursor is
above the block, within range of the number of lines in the block (i.e.
if the block was at the cursor, it would overlap itself) then the rows
of the block will swap with the rows of the swap region (the width
remains the same).  In any other case, the swap region will have the
same number of rows, allowing a different number of columns to be
swapped.

   The swap region can be sized by using the arrow keys; in conjunction
with `Ctrl' the swap will be made the same size as the block.  `Home'
will move to the first line or column of the swap and `End' to the last.
`Enter' will accept the swap, `Esc' will cancel it.

SyntaxSelect
============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+L'
Menu:   File > Select Language

   Select the language to be used for syntax highlighting.  If the same
language is chosen it will be re-read from file.  If no language is
chosen (i.e. an empty string) a list of all languages will be
displayed.  This is similar to the directory list (*note DirList::).
It displays the selected language, with its parent language in
brackets, if present; a semicolon- (DOS, Win32) or colon- (UNIX)
separated list of patterns; and how the language treats case (`inherit'
indicates the parent language determines case).  Sometimes you may see
duplicated languages; this is due to the language being defined both
locally and globally.

ToggleGraphicChars
==================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+G'
Menu:   Toggles > Graphic characters

   Turn graphic characters on or off.  When using graphic characters,
the numbers and minus are translated to drawing characters, with the
function keys controlling the type:

     `F1'      single line
     `F2'      double line
     `F3'      single horizontal, double vertical
     `F4'      double horizontal, single vertical
     `F5'      solid
     `F6'      ASCII

   Imagine a grid overlaid the numbers of the keypad to see how they are
translated, with `0' as the vertical line and `-' as the horizontal.
Solid mode is slightly different, though (for codepage 437):

     `0'       light shade
     `1'       medium shade
     `2'       lower half block
     `3'       heavy shade

Dialogs & Prompts
*****************

Dialogs
=======

Dialogs in TDE are quite simple, consisting only of edit fields and
check boxes.  Use `Tab'/`PgDn' and `Shift+Tab'/`PgUp' to switch between
edit fields and the function keys to toggle check boxes; `GotoMark<N>'
will move to the <N>th edit field.  To accept the values press `Enter';
`Esc' will cancel the dialog.  Cancelling a dialog will _not_
necessarily restore the original values (for example, turning on `RegX'
in `DefineSearch', then cancelling, will still leave the `RegX' option
on the next time).

   When a dialog is opened from a macro (either recording or playing),
all the check boxes will be cleared and the focus will be set to the
first edit field (however, a macro definition can include the flag
`UsesDialog' to prevent this).

Prompts
=======

Prompts (and edit fields) can be edited in much the same way as any
text in the editor.  If the first key is a character, `DeleteChar' or
`StreamDeleteChar', the initial answer will be erased.  The following
functions have the same meaning as their main editor counterpart:

     `BackSpace'          `EndOfLine'                 `Transpose'
     `BegOfLine'          `SetDirectory'              `WordDelete'
     `CharLeft'           `StreamCharLeft'            `WordDeleteBack'
     `CharRight'          `StreamCharRight'           `WordLeft'
     `DelBegOfLine'       `StreamDeleteChar'          `WordRight'
     `DelEndOfLine'       `ToggleOverWrite'           
     `DeleteChar'         `ToggleSearchCase'          

The following functions are also available:

     `AbortCommand'        cancel the prompt, keep original answer
     `BackTab'             filename completion
     `BegNextLine'         copy the string from the current window
     `CopyToClipboard'     copy the answer to the clipboard
     `CutToClipboard'      copy the answer to the clipboard
     `DeleteLine'          erase the answer, but add it to the history
     `Help'                display help for the command, if any
     `KopyToClipboard'     copy the answer to the clipboard
     `LineDown'            retrieve the next answer from the history
     `LineUp'              retrieve the previous answer from the history
     `NextLine'            copy the word from the current window
     `PasteFromClipboard'  copy the first line from the clipboard
     `Rturn'               accept the answer and add it to the history
     `ScrollDnLine'        complete next entry from the history
     `ScrollUpLine'        complete previous entry from the history
     `Tab'                 filename completion
     `ToggleCWD'           if the `DisplayCWD' option is off, display
                           the current directory above the prompt, or at
                           the bottom of the screen in a dialog

   The clipboard functions are only available to `tdep.exe' and
`tdew.exe'.

   Copying the word or string from the current window, or the line from
the clipboard, will use the insert or overwrite mode.  If it is the
first key pressed, the current answer will be erased.

   Filename completion is only available to functions that expect a
filename.  If the answer contains wildcard characters, each matching
filename will become the answer.  If there are no wildcards, the entire
answer will form the prefix of a filename.  The first completion will
add the characters common to all matching files; each subsequent
completion will be the filename itself.  Once all names have been
displayed, the common characters will again be shown.

   History completion will search the history for a line that matches
the answer up to the current cursor position.  The search mode case
will be used.

   Prompts that expect a filename (more specifically, any prompt that
uses the file history) will recognise a leading `~/' and substitute it
for TDE's home directory (`TDEHOME', `HOME' or the same path as the
executable).

Issues
******

Most users should have no problem running TDE, but there a few
situations that cause troubles.

TDEW & TZ
     If you need to use the `TZ' environment variable, include the
     abbreviation, otherwise the current time will be wrong.  Eg: use
     `set TZ=EST-10', not `set TZ=-10'.

TDEP & DR-DOS
     The built-in DPMI server needs to be used, otherwise the keyboard
     will not function correctly.

Cygwin/MSYS
     TDE will not run correctly in the shells of these environments.
     Use `start' to run TDE in a new console window.

arrow keys     the up, down, left and right keys (see below)
BOL            beginning of line -- the first column
CRLF           a text file where each line ends with a carriage return
               and line feed pair
EOF            end of file -- one more than the last line
EOL            end of line -- one more than the last character
