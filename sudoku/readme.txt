These puzzles were published in the local paper ("The Morning Bulletin"), which
credits them from www.knightfeatures.com.  The name is the puzzle number, the
extension is the difficulty (1 is easy, 5 is hard).  As another indication of
difficulty, I have included my completion times.  "Paper" is the very approx-
imate time it took me to complete the puzzle in the paper; "Sudoku Assistant"
is a Windows program very similar in operation to this TDE implementation,
which also tells you how long you took.  These were my very first Sudoku
puzzles, which explains the relatively longer paper times for the first few;
"+" means I made a mistake somewhere, but didn't bother finding it.
